# Sentence-Shuffler
Shuffles the text of multiple sentences within a text file, and pastes the shuffled text into a separate document.

This application is useful for teachers wanting to quickly make a large document of randomized word sorting problems. These types of problems will help English
learners become more familiar with specific grammar structures.

For example: A text document can be filled with sentences such as "I really like cats." and may be shuffled into "really cats. like I"

Afterwards, a teacher can take the randomly shuffled sentences and print them on paper, and have 
students try reorganizing the words back into the correct order.

How to use:

If you want to see the original code, please look at the dev branch of this repository.

Once downloaded, open the downloaded folder and open dist, then main. Write your sentences in the 'sentences.txt' file.

*NOTE* You can also make sure that two or more words are always side-by-side within the shuffled 
sentences by connecting multiple words with the "+" symbol.
